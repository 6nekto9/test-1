<p class="lw">The meanest dog you'll ever meet
<br> He ain't the hound dog in the street
<br>He bares some teeth and tears some skin
<br>But, brother, that's the worst of him
<br>The dog you really got to dread
<br>Is the one that howls inside your head
<br>It's him whose howling drives men mad
<br>And a mind to its undoing</p>
